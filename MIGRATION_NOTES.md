# Weaviate Migration Notes

## Overview

This document outlines the migration from Weaviate Cloud to a local Weaviate instance for the LETTA tools search functionality.

## Changes Made

1. **Connection Pattern Updates**:
   - Updated all scripts to use `weaviate.connect_to_local()` instead of `weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud()`
   - Removed requirements for `WEAVIATE_API_KEY` as it's not needed for local connections
   - Updated environment variable checks to only require `OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **Files Updated**:
   - `upload_tools_to_weaviate.py` (root directory)
   - `final tools/upload_tools_to_weaviate.py`
   - `final tools/test_weaviate_search.py`
   - Other files were already updated: `weaviate_tool_search.py`, `weaviate_tool_finder.py`, `init_weaviate_schema.py`

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Local Weaviate instance runs on `localhost:8080` (HTTP) and `50051` (gRPC)
   - Docker configuration in `docker-compose.yml` sets up the local Weaviate instance
   - `.env` files updated to point to local instance

## Usage Instructions

1. **Starting the Local Weaviate Instance**:
   ```bash
   cd "final tools"
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Initializing the Schema**:
   ```bash
   python init_weaviate_schema.py
   ```

3. **Uploading Tools**:
   ```bash
   python upload_tools_to_weaviate.py final\ tools/all_letta_tools_20250424_031246.json
   ```

4. **Testing the Search**:
   ```bash
   cd "final tools"
   python test_weaviate_search.py
   ```

## Verification

The migration is successful when:
1. Tools can be uploaded to the local Weaviate instance
2. Search queries return relevant results
3. All scripts run without errors related to Weaviate connection

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure Docker is running and the Weaviate container is healthy
2. Check that the OpenAI API key is valid in the `.env` file
3. Verify that the local Weaviate instance is accessible at `localhost:8080`
