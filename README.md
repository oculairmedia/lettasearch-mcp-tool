# LettaSearch MCP Tool

A system designed to enhance Letta agents with dynamic tool management capabilities. It allows agents to search for, attach, and detach tools based on natural language queries.

## Overview

The LettaSearch MCP Tool is a system designed to enhance Letta agents with dynamic tool management capabilities. It allows agents to search for, attach, and detach tools based on natural language queries, making them more versatile and capable of handling a wider range of tasks.

The system consists of several components that work together to provide seamless tool management:

1. **API Server**: A Flask-based server that handles requests for tool search and attachment
2. **Weaviate Integration**: Vector database for semantic search of tools
3. **MCP Tool Management**: Handles registration and management of MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
4. **Docker Containerization**: Ensures consistent deployment across environments
